versions-maven-plugin
=====================

patched original with some reporting addons

I forkes the original maven versions plugin due to lack of response from the maintainers.

I'd like to see some xml reports implemented like 

https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MVERSIONS-154

https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MVERSIONS-234

Roadmap
========

Merge the changes from latest original revision and release (keep synced)


Code contribution
=======
Everything welcome according to report on updates. 

Don't refactor ... yes I know it is the first thought u might have, when you see the code .... don't ! It makes the merging horrible.
